The team discussed implementing the MCP (Model Context Protocol) everywhere mandate, which has evolved to require remote-first access primarily for agents rather than local execution. The conversation focused on technical approaches for accessing web lab data through Andy's/Westlake, authentication mechanisms, and security considerations for the new implementation. Key decisions were made regarding authentication libraries and AWS account setup requirements.

## Technical Implementation Approach
Two main approaches were discussed for data access: using Andy's SDK for Python within Lambda functions for known queries like TAA lookups, and implementing natural language to SQL conversion through MCP for more complex requests. The team identified that most MCP use cases will likely involve accessing Andy's data, making this a critical integration point. Examples and documentation were shared for connecting to Andy's from SageMaker notebooks, which can be adapted for Lambda implementation.

## Authentication and Security
The Unified Auth library was identified as the recommended solution for MCP authentication, designed specifically to handle both agent and human traffic with cloud authentication support. This addresses the key concern of caller identification and protection. The team discussed AWS account setup requirements, noting that a security review process will be necessary, with classification depending on data sensitivity levels (orange vs highly confidential based on customer data exposure).

## API Access Considerations
While web lab API access was discussed as a future need, concerns were raised about guardrails and potential abuse scenarios. The team acknowledged that API access presents risks due to lack of current throttling mechanisms and potential for automated loops. A phased approach was suggested, starting with read-only data access before considering API integration with proper rate limiting and authentication keys.

## Decisions
-   MCP implementation must be remote-first and accessible primarily by agents
-   Will use Unified Auth library for MCP authentication to handle both agent and human traffic
-   Start with read-only data access from Andy's/Westlake before considering API access
-   Create new AWS account for MCP implementation with proper security review process

## Next steps
-   Investigate Andy's data access through Lambda using provided Python SDK examples
-   Review Unified Auth library documentation and implementation approach
-   Initiate AWS account creation and security review process
-   Collect additional use cases from stakeholders
-   Consider API throttling and guardrails for future web lab API integration
