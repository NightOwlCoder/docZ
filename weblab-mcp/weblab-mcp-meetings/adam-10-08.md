The meeting centered on developing a Web Lab MCP (Model Context Protocol) to meet new organizational mandates requiring remote-first data exposure capabilities. The discussion covered technical architecture decisions, user experience considerations, and implementation roadmap planning. Key focus areas included understanding experimenter use cases, addressing data freshness limitations, and defining the scope of initial read-only functionality versus future write capabilities.

## Technical Architecture and Constraints
The mandate change to remote-first architecture simplified the technical approach by enabling IAM role-based data access instead of local authentication tokens. However, Westlake table publication SLAs present limitations, particularly for web lab metadata which has one-day SLAs and may not reflect newly created experiments immediately. The team discussed implementing dual data sources - Westlake for historical data and Web Lab APIs for real-time needs when immediate access is required.

## Experimenter Use Cases and Requirements
The primary use cases center around operational questions from experimenters, including tracking experiment status, understanding why analyses aren't completing, and monitoring metric results. Common scenarios include users wanting to know where their data is, why results aren't available, and whether experiments are trending positively. Policy owners need broader visibility across multiple experiments to identify compliance issues, while individual experimenters focus on single experiment health and progression.

## Current User Behavior and Pain Points
Discussion revealed that some users resort to web scraping instead of using available APIs, highlighting potential gaps in API discoverability or usability. The conversation identified opportunities to better educate users about existing programmatic access options and improve the overall user experience for data access.

## Implementation Roadmap
The roadmap prioritizes read-only functionality initially, with write capabilities planned for future phases once appropriate safety measures and guardrails are established. Immediate priorities include exposing common operational data, experiment health metrics, and basic reporting capabilities. Future enhancements may include log access for troubleshooting and more sophisticated automation features.

## Decisions
- The MCP will be remote-first using IAM roles for data access instead of local authentication
- Initial focus will be on read-only functionality with write capabilities planned for future phases
- Will include transparency about data freshness limitations, particularly for newly created web labs
- Consider adding real-time API tools as a secondary option for immediate data needs

## Next steps
- Share common query examples and use cases from previous intern automation work
- Provide table names for reports-to information and bingle mapping (requires security review)
- Forward relevant customer questions and use cases to help define MCP requirements
- Document data freshness limitations and SLAs in the MCP roadmap
- Explore log access capabilities as a P1 feature for troubleshooting support
