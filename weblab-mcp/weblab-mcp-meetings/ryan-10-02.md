**OH: discuss MCP with SIbagy**

The meeting addressed developing an MCP strategy for the web lab platform following a company mandate requiring teams with over 100 customers to implement MCP-facing solutions. The discussion explored creating AI-powered tools to improve how users access and analyze web lab data, moving beyond inefficient practices like web scraping APT reports. The team identified significant opportunities to leverage existing Andes tables through natural language interfaces and discussed various user workflows that could benefit from AI assistance.

## MCP Strategy Development 
The web lab team was flagged for MCP implementation due to having over 100 customers using `WSS` according to company measurements. Rather than exposing all existing `WSS` functionality, the strategy focuses on building targeted AI tools that address real user needs. The approach emphasizes creating modular building blocks that can be combined for different use cases, allowing flexibility for integration with various AI platforms while avoiding the cost burden of hosting LLM processing.

## Data Access and Andes Integration 
A key technical challenge emerged around connecting MCP tools to Andes tables, despite customers having access to Westlake data through existing interfaces. The team identified that users are currently resorting to web scraping when they could access the same information through SQL queries in seconds. The Andes MCP tool already demonstrates natural language to SQL translation capabilities, but access issues need resolution for broader adoption. 

## Use Case Identification 
Several concrete use cases were discussed, including automated TAA detection workflows, allocation history tracking, and experiment status monitoring. The team recognized that many current use cases focus on problem resolution and support scenarios, representing only a small fraction of potential applications. Future tools should address both reactive support needs and proactive experiment guidance for users unfamiliar with web lab processes. 

## Integration with Existing Tools 
The discussion explored how new MCP tools could complement `WLBR.AI` and other existing platforms. `WLBR.AI` currently relies on user prompts and wiki information but doesn't pull from Andes tables, presenting an integration opportunity. The vision includes creating conversational workflows that guide users through experiment setup, treatment validation, and results interpretation using AI-powered analysis of web lab data.

## Decisions
-   Focus on building modular tools (building blocks) rather than trying to capture all possible use cases upfront
-   Prioritize creating AI tools powered by Andes tables for natural language data querying
-   Target both operational support use cases and proactive experiment guidance workflows

## Next Steps
-   Continue collecting use cases from team members and stakeholders
-   Investigate technical issues preventing MCP connection to Andes tables
-   Attend Arpit's presentation on natural language querying of Andes (S&T 10/03)
-   Collaborate with science team on specific data access requirements
-   Draft roadmap with prioritized tool development based on collected use cases
