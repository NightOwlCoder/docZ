# Weblab MCP Demo Update - Quick Recovery from Morning Hiccup

Hi [Director Name],

## The Challenge
Despite successful testing last night (9pm), we hit an unexpected compatibility issue this morning at 8am - the MCP server failed to load in Q due to a Node.js version conflict that emerged overnight. The Weblab tools weren't showing up in Q's `/tools` command right as we were starting the demo.
