## Phase 2.1: Foundation & Investigation (Weeks 1-3)

### AWS Account & Bindle Setup

**Why Critical:** Need dedicated AWS account with proper bindle for team access before development

- [ ] Create Software Application Bindle: `WeblabMCPServer`
- [ ] Configure bindle permissions for team
- [ ] Request AWS account via Conduit
- [ ] Wait for approvals (~30 min)
- [ ] Verify account access via Isengard
- [ ] Determine security classification (orange vs confidential)
- [ ] Submit security review (staged - can start dev before approval)
- [ ] Configure account (IAM roles, S3, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager)

**Resources:**

|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Oct 2, 2025 | Remote Strands agent (not local fork) | MCP Everywhere mandate requires remote-first | Architecture pivot |
| Oct 9, 2025 | READ-ONLY for 2025 | Safety-first (William Josephson) | Write capabilities deferred to 2026+ |
| Oct 8, 2025 | Use CloudAuth Python MCP SDK | Released Oct 2025, production-ready patterns | Simplifies auth implementation |
| Oct 10, 2025 | AndesClientPython + andes-mcp hybrid | Direct SDK for queries, MCP for NLâ†’SQL | Best of both approaches |

### Week 2 (Oct 14-18, 2025)
[To be filled in]

---

## Notes & Learnings

### From Phase 1
- Public APIs only (no page scraping)
- Authentication is complex but critical
- Testing with real users essential
- Tool descriptions matter for discovery
- 90% of API logic portable to Python

### From Meetings
- Michael: Can start dev in existing account temporarily
- Doug: CloudAuth Python MCP SDK released Oct 2025
- YJ: Users tolerant of higher latency with agents
- Adam: Data freshness = WSTLake (1-day SLA) + APIs (real-time)

### Technical Patterns
- Use brazil-runtime-exec for fast local iteration
- Pydantic workaround: Manual .so copy after build
- Python 3.10+ required (not 3.9)
- Partition keys mandatory for WSTLake performance
