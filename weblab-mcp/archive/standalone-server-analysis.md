# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Weblab MCP Standalone Server Analysis

**Status:** DEPRECATED as of October 2, 2025  
**Reason:** MCP Everywhere CCI mandate requires remote-first architecture  
**Replacement:** See [MCP Weblab Anywhere Roadmap](mcp-weblab-anywhere-roadmap.md)

---

## Why This Document is Deprecated

**Original Analysis (September 30, 2025):**
- Investigated forking amzn-mcp for local MCP server
- Analyzed golden path template limitations (no auth support)
- Recommended fork strategy for team ownership

**What Changed (October 2, 2025):**
1. **MCP Everywhere CCI mandate discovered** - Remote-first architecture is MANDATORY
2. **Chetan rejected merge** - amzn-mcp deprecating by end of October 2025
3. **Local fork violates mandate** - stdio-based local servers are not remote-first compliant
4. **Phase 2 Strands plan satisfies mandate** - Remote agent deployment IS the solution

**New Strategy:**
- ~~Local fork of amzn-mcp~~ ❌ Non-compliant
- **Remote Strands agent** ✅ Mandate-compliant

---

## Key Learnings Preserved

### What We Learned from This Analysis

**1. Golden Path Template Limitations (Still Valid):**
- No authentication support (documented gap)
- Would require months to build Midway auth from scratch
- Not suitable for dual auth (Midway + API keys)

**2. Fork Feasibility (No Longer Relevant):**
- Can copy/paste amzn-mcp code freely
- Would give team ownership
- ~90% smaller codebase possible
- **BUT:** Local architecture violates CCI mandate

**3. Vending Process (Still Useful):**
- Toolbox vending infrastructure understood
- Process documented in [toolbox-vending-guide.md](toolbox-vending-guide.md)
- Metrics approaches investigated

**4. Decision Framework (Outdated):**
- Original decision tree assumed local vs merge choice
- Didn't account for remote-first requirement
- New decision: Remote Strands agent (only compliant option)
