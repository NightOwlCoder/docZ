# Keith - BYOK Process Question

## Question sent to Keith (9/18/25 5:09 PM)

Sergio Ibagy: Hey @keitnorm James has asked me a question about the BYOK workflow:
"e.g. what happens if we get 100s of requests"

I'm not sure how you guys handle key requests today, is there a process? I really don't see we received 100s of requests per day, but I would like to give him a clear answer.. ideas?

## Context

James McQueen is concerned about scalability if we announce MCP and suddenly get flooded with SIM tickets requesting API keys for higher TPS.

Need to understand:
1. How many API key requests does weblab team get today?
2. What's the process for handling them?
3. Is it automated or manual?
4. What would happen if volume increased significantly?
