# Comment for SIM Weblab-58126

## Improved Comment:

As an interesting data point on potential MCP usage and why we need proper API access:

**Lev Agreda (Finance) shared in #q-finance** ([Slack thread](https://amzn-wwc.slack.com/archives/C08GJKNC3KM/p1755214797979559)) how they built "Jarvis" - a Python automation tool that:
- Scrapes weblab metrics from APT Tool using Playwright browser automation
- Reduces 5 hours of manual work to 10 minutes
- Extracts 7 key metrics (OPS, GCCP, Ad Revenue, etc.) from experiment results
- Processes multiple weblabs in batch mode with treatment-specific extraction

**What the scraper does:**
1. Authenticates to internal sites using Midway cookies
2. Navigates to `https://apttool.amazon.com/weblab/find/` 
3. Applies complex filtering (5 criteria: View + Market + Date + GCCP + Status)
4. Extracts annualized metrics from APT regression analysis
5. Consolidates data for Finance reporting

**Script**: [simple_browser_jarvis.py](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T015GUGD2V6-F09AV8DR7DF/simple_browser_jarvis.py)

**This highlights key MCP benefits:**
- **Prevents fragile scrapers**: People are building browser automation because there's no API
- **Reduces backend load**: Scrapers generate full page loads vs efficient API calls
- **Better reliability**: APIs don't break when UI changes
- **Proper rate limiting**: MCP provides controlled access vs unthrottled scraping

For our traffic concerns, in the above scenario MCP would reduce load by:
- Eliminating inefficient browser automation
- Providing cacheable, structured API responses
- Implementing proper rate limiting and throttling
- Preventing duplicate requests from multiple scrapers

This Finance team's 96% time reduction shows clear demand for programmatic weblab access.
MCP can provide the proper solution without the brittleness of web scraping.
