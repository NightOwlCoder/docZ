# Demo Prep for Vignesh Meeting - Weblab MCP Integration

## Key Questions & Answers

### Q: How does Weblab MCP work with WLBRai?

**Answer:**
Weblab MCP provides the **foundational API layer** that WLBRai can leverage:

- **Weblab MCP** = Direct API access to Weblab data (details, allocations, history)
- **WLBRai** = Higher-level analysis and recommendations on top of that data
- **Integration**: WLBRai can call MCP tools to fetch real-time experiment data, then apply its AI analysis

Think of it as:
```
WLBRai (Analysis Layer)
    â†“
Weblab MCP (API Access Layer)
    â†“
Weblab API (Data Source)
```

### Q: How does this work with Arpit's WSTLake querying?

**Answer:**
Complementary approaches serving different needs:

- **Arpit's WSTLake**: Historical data analysis, aggregated metrics, performance trends
- **Weblab MCP**: Real-time API access, current state, configuration details
- **Together**: Complete picture - historical trends (WSTLake) + current state (MCP)

Example workflow:
1. WSTLake: "Show me conversion trends for experiment X over past 30 days"
2. Weblab MCP: "What's the current allocation for experiment X?"
3. Combined insight: "Experiment X showed 5% lift historically, currently at 50% allocation"

## Message to Doug/Arpit

### Enhanced Version of Your Message:

Hey Doug and Arpit,

For tomorrow's MCP demo with Vignesh, we should be aligned on how our three approaches complement each other:

**Current State:**
- **Weblab MCP** (Sergio): Real-time API access to experiment details, allocations, and history
- **WLBRai** (Doug): AI-powered analysis and recommendations layer
- **WSTLake Query** (Arpit): Historical data analysis and metrics aggregation

**How They Work Together:**
The Weblab MCP serves as the **foundational API layer** that other tools can build upon:

```
User Query â†’ Agent Orchestrator
                â”œâ†’ Weblab MCP (current state)
                â”œâ†’ WSTLake (historical data)
                â””â†’ WLBRai (AI analysis)
```

**Key Points for Demo:**
1. Each tool solves a different piece of the puzzle
2. They can work independently OR be orchestrated together
3. MCP provides the "plumbing" for real-time Weblab data access
4. Agent orchestration can combine all three for comprehensive insights

**Example Use Case:**
"Analyze my team's experiments"
- MCP: Fetches current experiments and configurations
- WSTLake: Provides historical performance data
- WLBRai: Generates recommendations based on both

What do you both think? Should we do a quick sync before the demo?

## Technical Positioning Points

### Weblab MCP Strengths:
- **Real-time data**: Direct API access, always current
- **Simple integration**: Standard MCP protocol, works with any AI agent
- **Production ready**: 2179 tests passing, code review (8.5/10)
- **Authenticated**: Proper Midway + API key authentication

### Integration Architecture:
```yaml
Current Tools:
  - weblab_details: Get experiment metadata
  - weblab_allocations: Check treatment percentages  
  - weblab_activation_history: Track changes

Coming Soon:
  - weblab_search: Find experiments by team/owner/status
  - weblab_override: Test treatment assignments
  
Integration Points:
  - Input: Natural language queries from any AI agent
  - Output: Structured JSON data for further processing
  - Authentication: BYOK or shared community key
```

### Demo Flow Suggestion:

1. **Individual Demos** (5 min each):
   - Sergio: Show MCP fetching real-time experiment data
   - Arpit: Show WSTLake historical analysis
   - Doug: Show WLBRai recommendations

2. **Integration Story** (5 min):
   - User asks: "Should I increase allocation for experiment X?"
   - MCP: Current state (50% allocation, 3 treatments)
   - WSTLake: Historical performance (+5% conversion)
   - WLBRai: Recommendation (increase to 75% based on data)

3. **Future Vision** (5 min):
   - Unified agent orchestrating all three
   - Natural language to insights pipeline
   - Self-service experiment optimization

## Quick Facts for Demo

### Current Status:
- âœ… 3 tools implemented and tested
- âœ… Authentication working (Midway + API keys)
- âœ… code review passed
- âœ… Working Backwards doc published
- ðŸ”„ Search API in discussion with Steven/Livia
- ðŸ“… Hackathon next week for integration work

### Usage Metrics (if asked):
- Potential users: 4000+ developers with amzn-mcp
- Current testing: Internal team validation
- Production timeline: Post-hackathon integration

### Key Differentiator:
"We're not replacing the Weblab UI - we're making Weblab data accessible wherever developers work: IDE, Slack, command line, or any AI assistant."
