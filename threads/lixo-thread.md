More background of the mShop Android dial up. When we first dial up we saw the latency issue, because we didn't divided equally and also have TAA, so we think this may be the reason. Then we dial down, rerandomized and dial up to 50%C and 50%T2. We monitored three days, and from the andes table didn't see any imbalance treatment traffic. But from the central latency we found the treatment traffic differs a lot. So we decided to use 50% T1 and 50%T2, here T1 is actually same as C, but we think using T1 can avoid the issue.
When I tried to set the allocation from 50%C and 50%T2 ---> 50%T1 and 50%T2, I encounter the policy issue, so I tried to modify it to 33%C, 33%T1 and 33%T2.
The reason why I raise this request is we still want to use 50%T1 and 50%T2.

our manager asked to clarify this points:

Hi all,
I had a quick sync with Vignesh about the exception we are requesting (for the mShop weblab dial-up).
Time is of the essence because Vignesh goes on vacation at the end of the day and he wants to support our request.  Michael and I will be stuck in OLRs for a few hours so Sergio if you can collaborate with Yiming on updates to the exception request that would be ideal.
Once you think it is ready, please let me and Michael know and we will try to spare some time for a review.
Here are the concerns to address:
The 33/33/33 part is confusing and doesn't really add any value (ie no point in talking about stuff we tried, just focus on what we need)
Provide clarity about the exposure (ie that we are keeping any blast radius as small as possible).  I'm assuming we are only doing 1%, but we aren't making that clear.
Add some intro text to explain why T1/T2 is the right model (mshop appstart weblab blah blah)
It may seem repetitive, but for our answer to 4b make it clear we are doing this because we believe this was caused by a TAA.  We can also add that we would roll back if this turned out not to be true, that we would implement this change and deliver it to a specific RC cut (make sure we have a date there)
Link to the MCM and in particular link to both how we are monitoring for health and how we will roll back.  Make it clear we will monitor for latency
Anything else you can see in this that might be confusing

Yming wants to write this new clarification in the request:
---
1. What we want: we want to dial up as 50% T1 and 50%T2. Here T1 is same as C which use our V1Client, T2 is using V1Client and init V2Client.
2. Exposure: We will start from 1% and monitor for 2 hours. then increase to 5% monitor for 2 hours. We are targeting to increase to 25% at 8/15. And monitor for three days.
3. In central latency, the dashboard aggregated 7 days data and we have a TAA in first dial up. Because of that we see the traffic in C is much higher than T2. Using T1 can let the dashboard ignore previous wrong data in C and recalculate using T1 and T2.
4. We think the latency issue is caused by TAA, because we only see this in four marketplaces and after analyze the ClickToInteractive metrics we found in other market places the performance actually improved. We would roll back( dial down) if we still see the latency issue.
5. MCM: https://mcm.amazon.dev/cms/MCM-130432257
6. MCM STEP: https://mcm.amazon.dev/cms/MCM-130432257#steps in all Verify step, we will monitor the latency dashboard.

Background & Context:
We're running weblab MBM_ANDROID_V2_CLIENT_1083093 to verify our new V2 weblab client (Rust-based) before full migration from old V1 client. This is part of our broader V1â†’V2 client migration strategy.

What We Want:
Change allocation from current 50%C + 50%T2 to 50%T1 + 50%T2.
- C (Control): V1 client only
- T1: Functionally identical to C (V1 client only)
- T2: V1 client + V2 client initialization (V2 downloads allocation files in background, V1 handles all actual functionality)

Why T1/T2 Model:
During initial dialup, we encountered a TAA issue. Central latency dashboard aggregates 7-day historical data, and we're seeing traffic differences between C and T2 in the central latency system (though Andes table shows balanced traffic). Using T1 (functionally identical to C) gives us another set of data, that makes sure that that client did indeed receice a treatment, instead of default/null treatments.

Evidence of TAA Impact:
- Latency regressions only appeared in 4 marketplaces (JP, BR, IT, US)  
- Other marketplaces actually showed performance improvements
- Andes table shows balanced traffic, but central latency shows significant treatment imbalance

Exposure & Risk Mitigation:
We will start the dial up process this Monday, 8/18.
- Start: 1% for 2 hours monitoring  
- Increase: 5% for 2 hours monitoring
- Target: 25% with 3-day monitoring period
- This keeps blast radius minimal while gathering sufficient data

Monitoring & Rollback:
- MCM: https://mcm.amazon.dev/cms/MCM-130432257
- Monitoring: All MCM verification steps monitor latency dashboards per https://mcm.amazon.dev/cms/MCM-130432257#steps
- Rollback Criteria: If latency regression persists after dialup, immediate dialdown to 0%
